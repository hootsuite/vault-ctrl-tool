 * secrets that are only output raw fields can now have a lifetime of "version". The output of these fields
   will be updated when the version # of the secret changes
 * output of raw fields support base64 decoding
 * secrets can be pinned to a specific version - this is generally inadvisable, but can be done if needed
   for testing
 * secrets with lifetime of "version" can specify a "touchfile" which is touched when any fields are rewritten (for
   external services to trigger refreshes). Touchfiles are only touched after fields are rewritten.

 * vault-token ConfigMap supports "renewable" which is used to tell v-c-t to not renew the vault token in the ConfigMap
 * TOKEN_RENEWABLE environment variable can be used to disable renewing a passed in VAULT_TOKEN
 * --token-renewable can be set to "false" to disable renewing the token passed in on the command line
 * NOTE: these mechanisms only disable their respective token. For example TOKEN_RENEWABLE=false has no effect on ConfigMap
   or tokens passed in as CLI args.

 * Started CHANGELOG
 * Added provisional file locking around sync runs to prevent concurrent modification
 * --init in Kubernetes will now function as a --sidecar --oneshot instead of re-authenticating (this is to
   work around Kubernetes issues where init containers will re-run)
