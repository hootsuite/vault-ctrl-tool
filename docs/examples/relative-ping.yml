# This will insert an example secret into an existing template file.
# Note the path is relative, so v-c-t prefixes it automatically with /secret/application-config/services/secret/
# This can be overridden with --secret-prefix.

# Useful if you already have a configuration file that just needs some secrets populated into it.
