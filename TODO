I infrequently touch this project, when I do I usually have some other goal in mind, this is a doc for notes
on other things that need to happen.

Make Init and Sidecar More Similar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some edge cases in sidecar mode that, in order to resolve them, make sidecar mode need to operate like
init mode.  Therefore, the next time a bit of work needs to get done in either init or sidecar the code paths should
be collapsed to be one such that the work done during init can also be done during sidecar. This includes handling
(re)authentication and writing out files (to a temporary filename and renaming them into place).


FATAL Cleanup (Progress: ~85%)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go 1.13 officially supports rethrowing errors, use Errorf to do this and bubble them up.
